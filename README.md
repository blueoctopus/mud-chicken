# mud-chicken

An embryonic implementation of a MUD in Chicken Scheme.

The idea of this project is to be used as a starting point for anyone who wants
to develop and grow a real MUD on top of it.

Don't expect to play it, there is not much to see in that regard. :)

## running

Execute the script `run.scm`. It'll listen to connections on localhost,
port 4000. The player password is hardcoded to `xxx`.
